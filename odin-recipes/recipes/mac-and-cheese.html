        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>2 Cups Uncooked Elbow Macaroni</li>
            <li>0.5 Cup of Butter</li>
            <li>2x 12oz cans Evaporated Milk</li>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>4 Cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Pinch Paprika (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit <em>or</em> 220 Degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>Spray a 9inch x 13inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. 
                Stir in the macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, 
                stirring occasionally, until it has cooked through but is still 
                slightly firm, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Slowly melt butter in a large pot over low heat. Stir in evaporated
                 milk and black pepper; cook until heated through.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth; whisk about 1/2 cup of the evaporated
                 milk mixture into the eggs, 1 tablespoon at a time, until thoroughly
                  incorporated. Whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with 
                  evaporated milk mixture. Continue to heat gently, whisking constantly, 
                  until the evaporated milk mixture almost comes to a simmer and the
                   sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Gently mix salt and macaroniinto the sauce and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1/4 of the macaroni mixture in a layer into the bottom of the prepared 
                casserole dish and top with 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Repeat layers three more 
                times; top last cheese layer with paprika to taste.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove dish from oven with your favorite pair of oven mitts, wait a few minutes to cool down then enjoy!</li>
