        <h1>Lists Assignment</h1>
        <p>This is the list assignment for the Odin project. They want us to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create an unordered shopping list of my favorite foods.</li>
            <li>Create an ordered list of todo's that need to be done today.</li>
            <li>Create an unordered list of places that i'd like to visit. </li>
            <li>Create an ordered list of my all time top 5 favorite video games.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I've decided to attempt this in the sort of way where there's a list within a List
           in order to act as some sort of challenge, completed as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Unordered Shopping list of Favorite Foods:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steak</li>
                    <li>BBQ Chicken</li>
                    <li>Porkchops</li>
                    <li>Romane Lettuce Salads</li>
                    <li>Mexican food</li>
                    <li>Italian food</li>
                </ul>
                <p> </p> <!-- I added these paragraphs to create more space in between the lists.
                            theres probably a better way to do this, but this method works just fine.-->

            <li>Ordered todo list for today:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Practice Coding</li>
                    <li>Make money</li>
                    <li>Take COVID test</li>
                    <li>Sign back up for college courses</li>
                </ol>
                <p> </p> <!-- This is another one. -->

            <li>Unordered list of places I would like to visit someday:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Australia</li>
                    <li>Japan</li>
                    <li>Germany</li>
                    <li>Alaska</li>
                    <li>South Korea</li>
                </ul>
                <p> </p> <!-- This is the last one. -->

            <li>Ordered list of top 5 video games:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Monster hunter (series)</li>
                    <li>Persona 5</li>
                    <li>Halo (series)</li>
                    <li>Bioshock</li>
                    <li>Deadspace (1 + 2)</li>
                </ol>
        </ol>

        <p>That concludes the assignment given to me by The Odin Project.
        It has lists nested within nested lists, and should perform well.</p>
