        <h2>Hello World!</h2>

        <p>This is just a practice input of text.</p>
        
        <p>This is also another practice input of text, however, 
           this one shows that two seperate <strong>'p'</strong> tags are needed in 
           order to create multiple paragraphs.</p>

        <p><em>Following this will be examples of the different heading sizes no. 1-6.</em></p>

        <h1>This is a heading 1.</h1>
        <h2>This is a heading 2.</h2>
        <h3>This is a heading 3.</h3>
        <h4>This is a heading 4.</h4>
        <h5>This is a heading 5.</h5>
        <h6>This is a heading 6.</h6>

        <p><strong><em>So text can be both bold and italicized by combining the "strong", and "em" tags</em></strong></p>

        <!--So apparently these elements are ones used to add comments within the code-->
        <p>Following this is an example of an unorganized list:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Things that are in this list have no particular order.</li>
            <li>These lists typically have bullet points instead of numbers.</li>
            <li>There is no rank of importance within these lists.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Folloeing this is an example of an ordered list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>As you can see this list is numbered based on importance.</li>
            <li>All ordered lists have a particular order.</li>
            <li>The order is typically determined by the person coding.</li>
        </ol>
