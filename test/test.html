        <!--The following link is the link I used to learn about the different
        types of image files. Can be clicked for more info on the image files.
        What I provided here is a notated version of what's on there.-->
        <h1><strong>Different Types of Images used on the Internet</strong></h1>
        <p> There are <a href="https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/links-and-images/#image-formats"> 4 types</a> of different images that are 
            primarily used on the internet. <em>Those are as follows:</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>JPG Images</li>
                <li>GIF Images</li>
                <li>PNG Images</li>
                <li>SVG Images</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Each of these different type of image files serve different 
            purposes. They tend to be very good at serving the purpose that
            they were created for.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>JPG Images</strong></li>
                <p><em>JPG images are designed for handling large color 
                    palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size.</em>
                    This makes them great for photos that have lots of gradients.</p>

            <li><strong>GIF Images</strong></li>
                <p><em>GIFs are great when it comes to simple animations, however,
                    due to their limited color palette, they don't have a high level
                    of detail.</em> This is the biggest downside to this image
                    file type</p>
                
                <p> </p>
                <img src="images/mochi.gif" alt= "GIF image file of a bouncing smiley face">
                <p> </p>

            <li><strong>PNG Images</strong></li>
                <p><em>PNG images are great for anything that's not a photo OR
                    animation.</em> They tend to be larger than JPG files, but also
                    don't have a limit on their color palette,which makes them great 
                    for dealing with opacity.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <img src="images/mochi.png" alt= "PNG image of a smiley face">
                <p> </p>
            
            <li><strong>SVG Images</strong></li>
                <p><em>SVG images aren't pixel based, instead they are vector based.</em>
                Because they are vector based, they can be scaled to any size without losing
                picture quality.</p>
